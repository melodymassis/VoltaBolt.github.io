# VoltaBolt


Collaborated in a six person team to develop a website that helped consumers decide what electric car to purchase. As a team we identified the opportunity to create an all encompassing site that provided information on all current Electric Vehicles available in the US and where to purchase.

The team was broken up in Research and Development, Back End and Front End visualization. The team leveraged Beautiful Soup, JavaScript, and MongoDB. 

Visualization sample:

Leveraged D3 charting to create a visual aid for shoppers to make a comparison chart between:
	- Car model price
	- Mile range
