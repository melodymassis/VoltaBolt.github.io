**Electric_car**
    
NOTE: Summary of links also in excel file attached
![Links](Links.xlsx)

    1) Title: "What are the electric vehicles (EV) available in the US?"
			§ To do: Scrape whole table and store in DB
				https://pluginamerica.org/vehicles/?fwp_type=ev
				Tag: <table id="cars_table"…
			§ Idea: When hovering over the images, "price", "electric range"  and "rating" pop up. Price and electrics range are stored in this table we just scraped :)
			§ Exclude motorcycles and the Mercedes model from final product
		
	2) Image scraping: scrape image of vehicle with neutral background so we have a homogenous look for the hero images that will be plotted on the x/y axis

	3) Create an x and y axis on which to display the image of each vehicle, X showing mile range and Y showing price range
	4) Each image of the vehicle clicks through  => user is taken to official sites to learn full details/where to buy/etc.

	Select "ALL" states and scrape full table:
	https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/electric-vehicles-tax-credits-and-other-incentives
	
	Tag: <table id="results" class="display dataTable no-footer"
